This repository supports the "Dialogue Cartography" paper presented at ECA 2025 in Warsaw, Poland. The paper introduces a new argumentative dialogue analysis methodology and visualisation language which are applied to three exemplar dialogues:

* The Tipping Dialogue
* The Santa Claus Dialogue
* The Moon Landing Dialogue

The analysis are rendered into scalable PDF file and it is recommended to zoom/scale the visualisation as necessary to enable details and overview of the dialogue to be explored and investigated.
