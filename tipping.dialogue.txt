Title: The Tipping Argument
Dialogue Transcript:

Bob (1): It’s not so difficult. If you got excellent service, give a tip. Otherwise
don’t give a tip at all.
Helen (2): But how much should one give? And how can you judge whether service is excellent?
Bob (2): You just have to use common sense.
Helen (3): Come on Bob, that’s no answer! Common sense is often wrong,
isn’t it? What kind of criterion for good judgment is that?
Bob (3): Like most things in life, if you want to do something good, like reward excellence of service, you have to use common sense.
Helen (4): With tipping, common sense leaves too much open to uncer- tainty. Because of this uncertainty, both individuals involved can be offended. If the tipper gives too little, the receiver is embarrassed and uncomfortable. If the tipper gives too much, she can be embarrassed and uncomfortable. Thus the practice of tipping leads to embarrassment and discomfort.
Bob (4): A lot of students depend on tips to help pay their tuition costs. University education is a good thing. Discontinuing tipping would mean that fewer students could afford it.
Helen (5): That’s no problem. All we need to do is to raise the minimum wage.
Bob (5): That might just put a lot of restaurants out of business, with a result- ing job loss for students and others.
